# 🐱🐶 Image Tagging System using TensorFlow & Streamlit

An end-to-end **Image Tagging (Image Classification) system** built using **TensorFlow (CNN + Transfer Learning)** and deployed with a **Streamlit frontend**.  
The application allows users to upload an image and receive a predicted label along with a confidence score.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **image tagging system** that classifies uploaded images into predefined categories such as **Cat** and **Dog**.  
A **pre-trained MobileNetV2** model is used for feature extraction, making the system **CPU-efficient** and suitable for execution on local machines.

To improve real-world reliability, the application includes **confidence-based unknown detection**, preventing incorrect predictions for unrelated images (for example, human faces).

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Apply **transfer learning** to reduce training time and CPU usage
- Preprocess and normalize image data
- Deploy the trained model using a frontend web interface
- Display prediction results with confidence scores
- Handle unknown or unrelated images intelligently
